>AWS Storage Gateway provides a set of features that allow you to take advantage of AWS storage effectively in your existing applications and workflows. It provides a standard set of protocols such as ISCSI and NFS, which allow you to use your existing applications without making changes.

- Through its local cache, Gateway provides low latency access to data used frequently.

- The Gateway optimizes the transfer of data to the storage of AWS, such as the optimization of the transfer through the storage in smart buffer, the load administration to adapt to the variations of the network and the administration of the bandwidth.

- Gateway provides an effective mechanism for storing data in AWS throughout the storage service range most suitable for its use cases.

- Gateway is easy to implement and can use its existing virtual infrastructure and hypervisor investments, or can be installed in its data center or in remote offices such as a hardware device.

- The Gateway software that is executed as a virtual machine or in the hardware device without a state, which allows you to easily create and administer new instances of your gateway as your storage needs evolve.

- Finally, the service is natively integrated into AWS administration services such as Amazon Cloudwatch, Aws Cloudtrail, Aws Key Management Service (KMS) and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
