>AWS Lambda Service is a cloud computing platform that allows you to run code without the need to provision and manage servers. It is part of AWS services that are based on the "Function-as-a-Service" (FaaS) model. Here I will provide you with a detailed explanation about what the Lambda service is, the problems you can solve with it, its advantages and costs.

The AWS Lambda service allows you to efficiently and scalably execute code in response to events. You can write your code in one of the supported programming languages, such as Node.js, Python, Java, C#, and Go, and then upload it to Lambda. Once the code is loaded, you can configure the events that will trigger the execution of your function. These events can come from various AWS services such as S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, CloudWatch, among others.

Now, let's look at some of the problems you can solve with Lambda:

1. **Real-time event processing:** You can use Lambda to process events in real-time, such as uploading a file to S3 or logging a change to a database. You can run your code immediately and scale automatically based on event load.

2. **Building microservices:** You can use Lambda to build microservices without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. Each Lambda function can implement a specific part of your application's logic and be called independently.

3. **Task automation:** You can use Lambda to automate repetitive tasks or backend processes. For example, you can schedule a Lambda function to run at regular intervals to back up a database or send email notifications.

Now, let's talk about the advantages of the Lambda service:

- **Autoscaling:** Lambda automatically scales your code execution in response to loading events. No need to provision or manage server capacity.

- **Pay as you go:** You only pay for the execution time of your function and the amount of resources used during execution. There are no charges for downtime or unused capacity.

- **High availability:** AWS ensures high availability of the Lambda service. Your functions will run even if the underlying servers fail.

In terms of costs, Lambda's pricing is based on the number of requests and the amount of execution time consumed by your functions. You can refer to the AWS Lambda pricing page for specific details on the rates applicable to your region and expected usage volume.

In short, the AWS Lambda service is a cloud computing platform that allows you to run code without provisioning servers. You can solve a variety of problems, such as real-time event processing, creating microservices, and automating tasks. Its benefits include autoscaling, pay-as-you-go, and high availability. Costs are based on the number of requests and the execution time used.
