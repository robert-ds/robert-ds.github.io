**DevOps** is a methodology that combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) in a collaborative and agile approach. Its main objective is to accelerate the cycle of development, delivery and continuous improvement of software. Here is a detailed explanation:

1. **What is DevOps**: DevOps is a culture and set of practices that seek to remove barriers between development and operations teams. It fosters automation, collaboration, and continuous software delivery.

2. **What it is**: DevOps involves continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD), test and deployment automation, constant monitoring and feedback to improve iteratively.

3. **DevOps Advantages**:
     - **Faster delivery**: Allows you to launch new features and fixes more quickly.
     - **Higher quality**: Test automation reduces bugs and increases stability.
     - **Greater collaboration**: Facilitates communication between teams, reducing conflicts.
     - **Greater efficiency**: Automate manual tasks, saving time and resources.
     - **Greater visibility**: Constant monitoring to identify problems before they affect users.

4. **How to apply it**: Implement DevOps by following these steps:
     - **Culture**: Fosters collaboration and a continuous improvement mentality.
     - **Automation**: Automates development, testing and deployment processes.
     - **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Constantly integrate code and run tests.
     - **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Automatically deploy changes to test and production environments.
     - **Monitoring & Feedback**: Monitor apps and collect data to constantly improve.
