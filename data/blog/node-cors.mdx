>CORS stands for "**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing**" It is a security mechanism used in web browsers to restrict requests for resources from one domain to another. Node.js is a programming language used to build web applications and as such is also affected by the CORS security policy.

The primary goal of CORS is to protect web users by preventing malicious websites from accessing user data on other websites. Web browsers implement this security policy to prevent a malicious website from making unauthorized requests on the user's behalf.

In Node.js, we can enable CORS in our application using middleware. By enabling CORS, we can allow our web application to accept resource requests from different origins. We can configure the CORS middleware to allow requests from any origin or only from certain origins.

Conclusion, CORS is a security policy implemented in web browsers to protect web users. In Node.js, we can enable CORS in our application using middleware to allow resource requests from different origins.
