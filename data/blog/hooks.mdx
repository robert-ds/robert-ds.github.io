## What are Git Hooks?

Git Hooks are custom scripts that are automatically executed on specific events within a Git repository. These scripts allow you to automate tasks or execute custom actions before or after an event occurs in Git, such as committing or pushing.

There are different types of Git Hooks that can be used:

1. **Hooks related to the commit process**: These hooks are executed at different stages of the commit process, such as before commit (pre-commit), after commit (post-commit), when preparing the commit message commit (prepare-commit-msg) or by verifying the commit message (commit-msg).
2. **Email-Based Workflow Related Hooks**: These hooks are used in projects with an email-based workflow that uses the `git am` command to apply emailed patches.

## Problems that Git Hooks solve

Git Hooks solve various problems and offer significant benefits in developing web projects:

- **Task automation**: Hooks allow you to automate repetitive tasks, such as executing automated tests, formatting code, verifying coding standards, generating documentation, among others. This saves time and improves the productivity of the development team.
- **Code Quality Assurance**: Hooks can perform code checks and static analysis before committing changes. This helps to maintain the quality of the code and avoid the inclusion of bugs or bad practices in the repository.
- **Project Consistency**: Hooks make it easy to apply project-specific conventions and rules. They can ensure that coding standards, folder structure, file naming, and more are followed, ensuring consistency throughout the project.

## Advantages of using Git Hooks

Some advantages of using Git Hooks in web projects are:

- **Efficient automation**: Hooks allow you to automate tasks efficiently, saving time and minimizing human errors.
- **Customization**: The hooks are customizable and can be adapted to the specific needs of the project and the development team.
- **Workflow Integration**: Hooks are easily integrated into your existing workflow, as they are automatically executed on Git events.

## How to use Git Hooks in web projects

To use Git Hooks in web projects, you can follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the Git repository directory in your web project.
2. In the `.git` folder, you will find a folder called `hooks`. This folder contains the Git Hooks scripts.
3. Create or modify the hook scripts according to your needs. You can write the scripts in any programming language or use existing scripts.
4. Make sure the hook scripts are executable. You can do this by using the `chmod +x hook-name` command.
5. Once you have configured the hook scripts, they will be automatically executed in the corresponding Git events.

It's important to note that hooks are not automatically shared between team members in a remote repository. Each member must configure the hooks locally in their copy of the repository..
